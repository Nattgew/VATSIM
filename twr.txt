Issue wake turbulence cautionary advisories, e.g. "CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE" to:
	Visual approach or visual separation behind a Heavy or B757. 
	Any aircraft if in your opinion wake turbulence may have an adverse effect on it.

What is the WT restriction for departing behind arriving heavy? Take off through flight path?

Minutes of separation: start timer when begins to roll?

General separation requirements? When to issue tfc advisory?
